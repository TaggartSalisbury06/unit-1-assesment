// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const implementation = "This is the second step, where delopers will start started to build the product they have decided on making. depending on the method they use they will be talking and building the product to the specs they decided"

const design = "the third step is where the developers will start work on the design. if its front-end this means the look of how the user sees the project, if its back-end it will be how it function and is its user friendly or not and where it will be"

const maintain = "the fourth step is when developers keep what they're build perfect so that when they send it out its not full of bugs no one noticed"

const analysisAndRequirements = "the fith step is when developers decide what they need to look for before they test the project"

const testingAndIntegration = "This step is when the developers test the project to make sure it runs properly and if it does they out it out so it will now be usable"

const planning2 = "This stage of planning is where developers dicuss what the next project is and where the end goal will be"
